    "For the final project, you (and possibly one other peer) will complete a mini-project. For your project, you will complete a Jupyter notebook that contains an analysis program that shows off your newfound coding and visualization skills (with `Matplotlib` and `seaborn`) to help answer some interesting question(s) about a data set. This notebook must be thorough, well-structured, and convey something novel about the data (i.e., you cannot reproduce someone else's analysis). I should be able to go through the notebook top-to-bottom and understand (at minimum) the following:\n",

    "- Your choice of visualizations and how they help answer your question\n",

    "- Use of `pandas` for reading in data and organizing data frame\n",
    "- Proper subsetting of data and grouping\n",
    "- 2-3 figures (or subplot panels) that shed light on the data *and* your question of interest\n",
    "- Descriptive statistics - this should be available in the figure along with some textual explanation\n",
    "- Explanatory text regarding each major step (Note: The point here is to clarify your intent, not to be verbose. Be clear and succinct.)\n",

This is what data scientists do! It may be helpful (but not necessary) to find data that come as CSV files, and in long form. Of course, you are encouraged to figure out ways to wrangle other file types and less tidy data if you find the data set to be of interest. Remember, you can always Google \"[topic of interest] open data\", and there's a good chance you'll find something. **Regardless of the data you choose, you must not modify the original data file(s) in any way.**\n",
